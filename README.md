# Identify-the-landmarks-on-image-

 Detect Facial landmarks in a face.
Facial landmarks are used to localize and represent salient regions of the face, such as:
1. Mouth
2. Eyebrow
3. Eye
4. Nose
5. Jaw

In this program we try to detect the following facial landmarks using dlib, OpenCV,Python and then print and store those landmarks in a file.
1. Mouth
2. Right Eyebrow
3. Left Eyebrow
4. Right Eye
5. Left Eye
6. Nose
7. Jaw

# Understanding dlibâ€™s facial landmark detector
The pre-trainedfacial landmark detector inside the dlib library is used to estimate the location of 68 (x, y)-coordinates that map to facial structures on the face.The indexes of the 68 coordinates can be visualized on the image below:

![These annotations are part of the 68 points iBUG 300-W dataset which the dlib faciallandmark predictor was trained on.](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/facial_landmarks_68markup.jpg)
